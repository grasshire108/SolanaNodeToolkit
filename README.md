# SolanaNodeToolkit
Inspired by projects like solana-labs/solana but tailored for node operators, this toolkit addresses common pain points: manual setup, monitoring, and debugging. It automates these processes, saving hours of work.

# SolanaNodeToolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for Solana node operators (validators and RPC nodes). Automate deployment, monitor performance, secure configurations, and optimize throughput with ease.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy nodes on local, devnet, or mainnet-beta with one command.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track TPS, slot skips, and hardware metrics with Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- **Security Scanning**: Detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in node setups.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated ledger and key backups with one-command restoration.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize node settings for high TPS and low latency.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SolanaNodeToolkit.git
   cd SolanaNodeToolkit
