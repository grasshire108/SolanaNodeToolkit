# SolanaNodeToolkit
Inspired by projects like solana-labs/solana but tailored for node operators, this toolkit addresses common pain points: manual setup, monitoring, and debugging. It automates these processes, saving hours of work.

# SolanaNodeToolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for Solana node operators (validators and RPC nodes). Automate deployment, monitor performance, secure configurations, and optimize throughput with ease.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy nodes on local, devnet, or mainnet-beta with one command.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track TPS, slot skips, and hardware metrics with Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- **Security Scanning**: Detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in node setups.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated ledger and key backups with one-command restoration.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize node settings for high TPS and low latency.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SolanaNodeToolkit.git
   cd SolanaNodeToolkit

### Why This Repo Is Useful
- **Saves Time**: Automates repetitive tasks like deployment and monitoring, reducing setup time from hours to minutes.
- **Production-Ready**: Includes CI/CD, Docker, and modular code for scalability.
- **Community-Friendly**: Clear docs, MIT license, and PR templates encourage contributions.
- **Fills Gaps**: Unlike the official Solana repo, it focuses on operator needs (e.g., monitoring, backups) rather than protocol development.

### Next Steps
- **Host on GitHub**: Create a repo at `https://github.com/yourusername/SolanaNodeToolkit` and push these files.
- **Expand Features**: Add Telegram alerts, Firedancer integration, or a web UI based on community feedback.
- **Promote**: Share in Solana Discord, X, or awesome-solana lists to attract contributors.

If you want me to flesh out additional files (e.g., `monitoring.rs`, `backup_wallets.py`) or refine any part, let me know!
